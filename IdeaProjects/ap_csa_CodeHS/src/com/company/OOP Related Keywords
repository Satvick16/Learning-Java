    - static field: applies to all instances
        - changing it will change it everywhere
    - non-static field: applies to one instance
        - changing it will change it for one instance

    - static method:
        - can be used without creating an object
        - can access static fields
    - non-static method:
        - can be used after creating an object
        - can access static and non-static fields

    one need not know about the inner workings of a
    program in order to use it

Encapsulation:
    hiding the internal state of an object in order
    to control how users interact with a system
